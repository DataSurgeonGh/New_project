# New_project
My Machine Learning Journey
Using the popular packages Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations
I imported the salary data and call it using pandas pd.read_csv method
I sliced the data into dependent (labels) and independent variables (features)
Using seaborn, I plot some visualizations of the labels and features to see the distributions of the features and also see the relationship of the features with the labels, whether they are increasing together or decreasing together
Next I split the data into training and testing, I prefer to use the 70, 30 ratio for traning and testing
Next I fit a regresion model
